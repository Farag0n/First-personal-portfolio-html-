### Personal portfolio only with HTML

## Description:
In this case, I only used HTML, as it is my first project with it.
This project has many errors, but I want to leave it like this to keep a record of my progress.

## How the page looks:

## What errors does it have?:
- The `<header>` is very simple. It needs more meta tags.
- The code lacks semantic tags

For the moment I have not seen any more serious errors

### Conclusion:
For being my first project in HTML, it's not bad, but there's still a lot to improve.
